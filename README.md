# ProtoUnoSim
ProtoUnoSim was my very first coding project, and was created as a final project for a python class. The goal was to simulate a dulled down version of the popular 
card game 'Uno'. While very simple, it does include methods for both the 'skip' cards and 'draw two' cards from the classic game.
